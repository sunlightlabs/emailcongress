# Email Congress

Lightweight web app to courier email messages to phantom-of-the-capitol using postmark.

This is a work-in-progress to transform [The Phantom Mask](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/the-phantom-mask) to a more 
sustainable Django project with an API, provisioning, and more robust error handling. Oh yeah, also Python 3.

// TODO

- Forms
- Emailer
- Templates
- Finalize provisioning
- Complete API + add permissions
- Asset pipeline to upload to S3
- Sentry Error Reporting
- Test Suite
- CI Setup
